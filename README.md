# Reservation Hub

Reservation Hub is a React Native application built with Expo, designed for managing reservations across various sectors like grooming, accommodation, rental, and food. The app offers features such as location-based branch discovery, reservation management, and sector-specific functionalities.

## Overview

Reservation Hub aims to provide a seamless reservation experience for users, while also offering a robust management system for businesses. The app is built using a modular architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Login and signup functionality powered by Supabase.
- **Branch Discovery**: Find nearby branches based on your current location using PostgreSQL's PostGIS by Supabase.
- **Assets**: Dynamic assets for sector of the branch.
- **Custom Services**: Additional services for assets.
- **Reservations**: Make, view, and manage reservations with branch-specific details.
- **Dynamic Tabs**: Tab-based navigation tailored for different user roles and contexts.
- **Custom Components**: A variety of reusable UI components like buttons, cards, inputs, and modals.
- **Location Integration**: Leveraging `expo-location` and Google Maps for geolocation and branch mapping.
